   Dante was developed for Inferno Nettverk A/S, Norway by:
      - Michael Shuldman <michaels@inet.no>: Design and implementation.
      - Karl-André Skevik <karls@inet.no>: Autoconf and porting.
 

   In order of contribution, at least the following should be credited:

- David Koblas (koblas@netcom.com) authored the original Socks
  protocol and implementation.

- Ying-Da Lee (yingda@esd.sgi.com) maintained the socks4 package.
  Also thanks to him for letting us include the file describing the
  v4 protocol, "SOCKS4.protocol".

- The people at NEC (http://www.socks.nec.com) have done much for Socks,
  including extension of the orignal protocol.  The idea for "socksify"
  also came from them.

- Most of the compatibility functions were taken from OpenBSD and
  are copyright The Regents of the University of California.

  - The snprintf function is copyright Theo de Raadt (deraadt@theos.com)
  - The setproctitle replacement is taken from sendmail-8.8.8 and written
    by Eric P. Allman

- Jörgen Lundman (lundman@argonaut.com) provided invaluable help
  during the process of getting msproxy support into Dante.  Thanks
  a lot.  Jörgen Lundman would also like to thank Paul Leask
  for his time and effort in this project.

- Andrew Pimlott's (pimlott@math.harvard.edu) work on analysing
  the msproxy protocol was helpful and served to complement and
  speed up the process of adding msproxy support to Dante.
  Andrew Pimlott also has his own msproxy implementation, but as he
  is busy requests that people only contact him if they are desperate
  and Dante does not work for them.

- Thanks to Oren Tiorsh (oren@hishome.net) who contributed the rpm spec
  files.

- Thanks to Lars Brede Grøndahl from INN (inn.no) for the logo.

- Thanks to Jay Weber (jweb@accessus.net) for help with the
  digital unix port and an account to test it on.

- Malte Cornils <malte@cornils.net> for help with the HP-UX
  port.

- Also thanks to everyone who reported bugs and other problems.
