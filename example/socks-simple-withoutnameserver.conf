# A simple sample socks.conf for users without a local nameserver.

# Clients going anywhere go via the proxyserver listening at IP
# address 10.1.1.1, port 1080.  Uncomment the line(s) corresponding to
# the proxyprotocols your proxyserver supports.
#route {
#       from: 0.0.0.0/0   to: 0.0.0.0/0   via: 10.1.1.1 port = 1080
#       proxyprotocol: socks_v5              # server supports socks v5.
#       proxyprotocol: socks_v4              # server supports socks v4
#       proxyprotocol: http_v1.0       # server supports http v1.0
#}


# This is identical to the above, but it matches hostnames instead.
