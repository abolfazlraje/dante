* check warning about select() behavour incorrect, recent posix may

* checkmodule matches external against licesensed ipaddress, if external
  is an interface name however, it looks like it can contain multiple

  one licensed.

* there is a race condition in bw stuff between rulespermit() and
  bwuse().

* change _t struct's to typedef.

* allocate fd_set's with malloc() for overflow protection.

* share host/addr cache across processes.

* get and send all argument to old signalhandler when necessary.

* clean up namespace.

  sockaddr_in casts. causes coredump with ftp (passive ls) in client,
  in sockshost2sockaddr (util.c, line 271, version 1.94).

* match configure/manual config/pid location

* port code for interface/route info retrieval to OSF
