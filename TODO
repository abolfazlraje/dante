* add an option for the client to clean up all old dante upnp sessions
  at startup, if that is possible.  Currently each client should clean
  up for itself on normal exit, but if something special happens,
  it might not be done.

* add define for how many times to try a rule before blacklisting. 
  One could be default, zero disables blacklisting?

* change _t struct's to typedef.

* share host/addr cache across processes.

* get and send all argument to old signalhandler when necessary.

* clean up namespace.

* make requestchildren support multiple clients too.

* shrink io_t, too big.

* Solaris cc needs -misalign due to alignment problems with sockaddr/
  sockaddr_in casts. causes coredump with ftp (passive ls) in client,
  in sockshost2sockaddr (util.c, line 271, version 1.94).

* match configure/manual config/pid location

* port code for interface/route info retrieval to OSF

* IPV6 support
