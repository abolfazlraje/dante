To report a new bug, mail dante-bugs@inet.no.  Make sure you read
the FAQ first.

	Things known not to work:

- there appear to be some problems with "socksify" and NIS on at least
  some systems.  Somebody needs to look into what the problem is.

- msproxycode seems to crash at least some msproxy servers.  See
  README.msproxy for more information.  Also see the HTTP proxy
  support added to the client.

- 'libtool' is broken on OS X.

- If username/password authentication is used, the socks client will
  always get a successful response at first.  The username/password
  is not checked until the full socks request has been received
  from the client, at which point the request will fail if
  the username/password is incorrect in the same way it would if
  there was no "pass" rule for the request.

- The clientlibrary is not threadsafe, this can cause problems
  when trying to socksify programs that use threads.
