To report a new bug, mail dante-bugs@inet.no.  Make sure you read
the faq first.

	Things known not to work:

- there appear to be some problems with "socksify" and nis on at least
  some systems.  Somebody needs to look into what the problem is.

- msproxycode seems to crash at least some msproxy servers.  See
  README.msproxy for more information.  Also see the http proxy
  support added to the client.

- 'libtool' is broken on OS X.
