To report a new bug, mail dante-bugs@inet.no.
Make sure you read the FAQ (http://www.inet.no/dante/FAQ/) first.

Generic:
 - 'libtool' is broken on OS X.

Client part:
 - non-blocking connect(2) is broken when used via the socksify 
   library on most Linux kernels. 

   This isn't very difficult to fix, but requires some work.
   The fix is to find a way to create a filedescriptor that
   select(2) on Linux will not mark as either readable or writable,
   as Linux does this different from all other unix systems. 
   Linux does appear to be the one correct according to specs though.
   
   One way is to bind(2) an address (but not listen) and then
   make a non-blocking connect to it, but that is rather ugly.

 - The clientlibrary is not threadsafe.  This can cause problems
   when trying to socksify programs that use threads.

Server part:
    None known.
