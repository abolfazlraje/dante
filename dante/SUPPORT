Dante is developed by Inferno Nettverk A/S, Norway.

Dante is available under such a license that you can use it for
free.  Inferno Nettverk does however provide various commercial
services related to Dante.  This sponsors further development.

The services include both custom installs of Dante, performed over
the network if need be, as well as commercial support.

For more information about commercial installs and support please
contact info@inet.no.
Also see the Dante support page, http://www.inet.no/dante/support.html.


For non-commercial support, see http://www.inet.no/dante/lists.html
