This file describes the upgrade procedure from various versions of Dante
if any.

*** Upgrading from 1.2.x to 1.3.0

 o The HTTP_PROXY environment value must start with "http://".

 o The "-d" (debug) option now requires a value, setting the debug level.
   E.g., instead of "-d", one has to say "-d1", and instead of "-dd",
   one has to say "-d2".

 o Priority of proxy routes has changed, so that a socks v4 route is
   now preferred over a socks v5 route when both can be used, because
   v4 requests can be performed faster than v5 requests.

 o "child.maxidle: yes" is now the default setting, meaning most idle
   sockd child processes will be terminated automatically.

 o The config.h variables MAX_ROUTE_FAILS and BADROUTE_EXPIRE are now
   set in the configuration files instead of at compile time.
   The values are "route.maxfail" and "route.badexpire" and control
   how to handle bad routes (to e.g., a SOCKS/HTTP proxy server).

 o Option ordering in sockd.conf is now enforced, rather than just
   recommended.  Server options now always have to come before rules
   and routes.

 o The "srchost" parameter "nomismatch" has been renamed to "nodnsmismatch",
   while "nounknown" has been renamed to "nodnsunknown".

 o The default block rule no longer has logging of connect and iooperations
   enabled.
