* This is a prerelease.  Do not use this to upgrade from a previous
* release of Dante unless you want to help testing. 
*

o New version of the BSD version of "external.rotation = route"
  from Christoph Badura <bad@bsd.de>.

o Support for interfacenames in sockd rules, and in the destination
  address for socks routes.  
  Should make it easier to set up direct routes for local lan in
  the client (specify all local interfacename in route statements),
  and block connections to e.g. loopback addresses (specify the the
  loopback interfacename in a block rule) in the server.

o UPnP support in the client, using the miniupnp library by
  Thomas Bernard (http://miniupnp.free.fr/).

  UPnP is a protocol implemented by many home/small-business routers
  and adsl-modems.  It allows you to dynamically open up ports on
  the router for accepting incoming connections, as well as figuring
  out what the external ipaddress of the router is.

  Dante uses this to make socksify of ftp/bittorent/etc programs
  work via the UPnP router.

o Client libarary should be threadsafe now, allowing it to socksify
  threaded applications.

o Be less strict about bind in the client.  The standards says 
  it is expected that the client first performs a connect via
  the socks server, but it seems some/many socks servers support
  the client requesting a bind without a previous connect, so we 
  assume that is the case in the client from now on.

o Changed the magic bytes that indicate the client is requesing
  use of the Dante-spesfic bind extension from 0x00000000 to
  0xffffffff, as part of the process to become less strict about
  the bind command requiring a previous connection.

o Don't zero password in client if we read it from environment, or 
  it will not work the next time the same clientprocess tries to
  authenticate to the server.  Found by Pavel Fedin <fedin@matek.ru>.

  That mailaddress no longer works.  Please contact us if you have
  another address for Mr. Fedin.

o Fix bug that could prevent password authentication from working
  on some systems.  Spotted by Nathan Johnson <n.johnson@vanderbilt.edu>.

o Add support for "group:" syntax to rules, similar to "user:" statement.
  Requested by Don Harvie <donharvi@au1.ibm.com>

o Close connection to PAM server each time we get an error-reply from
  it, fixing a bug.
  Patch from Robert Marcano <robert@marcanoonline.com>.

o Incorrect assert fixed. Problem reported by
  "d binderman" <dcb314@hotmail.com>.

o Log close of client-rule with correct command.
  Fixes bug reported by Tom Vandenbelt <tvandenb@au1.ibm.com>.

o Update to autoconf 2.61 and libtool 1.5.26.
