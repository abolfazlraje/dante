* This is a prerelease.  Do not use this to upgrade from a previous
* release of Dante unless you want to help testing.

 o support interfacenames containing ':', e.g eth0:1, supposedly on
   linux 2.4.x.  From Rob Fowler <rfo@keta.mine.nu>.

 o new --disable-pidfile option to configure; disables pidfile creation.

 o upgrade to libtool-1.4.2, automake-1.5 and autoconf-2.52.

 o "-h" prints out configfile used, based on suggestion from
   dh_tsc_10@ugcs.net.

 o fix bugs that reset some defaults at the wrong time, reported by
   dh_tsc_10@ugcs.net.

 o prototype script for generation of graphs with usage information included
   (bin/sockd-graphgen). Contact us if you run a socks server with significant
   usage, and you are willing to help with testing.
