* release of Dante unless you want to help testing.

 o prefix "socks" to some global variables to avoid collisions during
   socksify.  Reported by Don Reid <donr@cvs.agilent.com>.

 o capi/socks.h needs Rxxx prototypes to work with a c++
   compiler. Noted by Alex Morozov <alex@idisys.iae.nsk.su>.

 o Fix compilation problems on Compaq Tru64 UNIX V5.0A (and V5.1 and V5.1A).
   Mainly based on patch from "Peter Derr" <pderr@islet.zk3.dec.com>,
   who also provided access to a machine for testing.

 o Fix bug that logged to stdout on startup sometimes, confusing
   some programs.  First reported by
   Vitor Choi Feitosa <vchoi@interlegis.gov.br>

 o If Rgetsockname() is called on a socket that a previous uncompleted
   Rconnect() has been done on, try to sleep until Rconnect() has 
   finished instead of returning ENOBUFS.  Hoped to help compatibility
   with some applications.

 o Modified httpproxy code a little, based on patch from
   dh_tsc_10@ugcs.net.

 o Code for selecting which of multiple external ipaddresses to use
   on a global basis based on routing. 
   Code contributed by Tom Chan <tchan@austin.rr.com>.

 o Re-open logfiles on SIGHUP.

 o Rename "pamservicename" to "pam.servicename".

 o Fix memory overrun problem in Rgethostbyname*().  Found and
   diagnosed by dme@dme.org, thanks.

 o Warn if "logoutput:" changes to something we don't handle after
   SIGHUP.

 o Try to log presumably harmless client-related errors with LOG_DEBUG
   instead of LOG_ERR, by popular request.

 o New module available: redirect, gives control over both
   where clients requests and replies will end up, aswell as what
   addresses and portranges the Dante server will use.
   Can also be used to limit the number of concurrent sessions
   from each client.
   See the module page "http://www.inet.no/dante/module.html" 
   and doc/module for more information.

 o New module available: bandwidth, gives control over how much
   bandwidth the Dante server uses on behalf of the different clients.
   See the module page "http://www.inet.no/dante/module.html" 
   and doc/module for more information.

 o upgraded to autoconf-2.50, libtool-1.4 and automake-1.4-p4
