* This is a prerelease.  Do not use this to upgrade from a previous
* release of Dante unless you want to help testing. 
*

o Use __libc_enable_secure if it exists and issetugid() doesn't.
  Should allow the SOCKS_CONF environment variable to be used on Linux.

o Check if large files need special support; logfiles can grow
  large.
  Problem reported by Tom Vandenbelt <tvandenb@au1.ibm.com>.

o Drop trying to optimize away unnecessary PAM calls, creates 
  obscure problems on some PAM-Linux implementations.
  Based on good work by Mr E_T <troll@arach.net.au>, many thanks.

o Fixed bug introduced as part of additions to better preserve TCP
  semantics across connections.
  Thanks to Rene Burkhardt <rene.burkhardt@ch.ibm.com>

o New module available: session.  This gives control over how
  many sessions different clients can create.
  See the module page "http://www.inet.no/dante/module.html" 
  and doc/module for more information.

o In order to share some code, there were some api changes
  made to the bandwidth module, requiring users to upgrade.
  Users of the bandwidth module can contact sales for a free upgrade.

o Fix bug preventing immediate-error on wrong password to take effect
  for servers configured to use PAM.
  Thanks for help to Rene Burkhardt <rene.burkhardt@ch.ibm.com>.

o Update usage of 'head'. Problem first reported by
  "William Adams" <wlarip@gmail.com>.

o Support server-chaining.  Currently only the tcp connect command
  is supported.  It might be possible to add support for UDP and
   tcp bind if requested.

o Fix PAM-related bug introduced in version 1.1.16.
  Reported by Jacob Toxværd <tox@microknights.dk>.
