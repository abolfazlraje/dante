***  Monday, Jul 12, 1999 -- Dante v1.1.0-pre2

 o fixed some of the finer details of the main i/o loop, lets hope 
   it doesn't brake anything.

 o pretend Rgetsockname() works on udp sockets; might help some programs.

 o tuned some things for better i/o performance though also greater
   resource usage.
 
 o better support for profiling.

 o The name and location of the configuration files can now be changed.
   Requested by Albert Chin-A-Young (china@thewrittenword.com).

 o fix bug introduced with last prerelease related to udp i/o in server;
   packet would get truncated if size was greater than about 256 bytes.

 o Problems with glibc-2.1 diagnosed. See the FAQ for details.

 o libtool-1.3.3

***  Monday, Jul 5, 1999 -- Dante v1.1.0-pre1

 o Building of dlib/interposition.c cleaned up.

 o tried to make logformat a little more consistent, not perfect yet
   though.

 o try to throttle childcreation if it looks like there is a problem.
   Suggested by Robert Loomans (robertl@jinx.silas.unsw.edu.au).

 o added a new method: "rfc931"; matches users against rfc931/ident
   lookup.  Requested by Per Hedeland (per@erix.ericsson.se).

 o added a new keyword: "user:"; limits the acceptable users on 
   a rule-by-rule basis.

 o rewrote addressmatch().  This sort of reverses the logic and is also no
   longer recursive.  Much Thanks to Per Hedeland (per@erix.ericsson.se)
   for pointing out some problems here and helping with making this
   hopefully more correct, any mistakes are obviously my own.

 o SIGINFO signal is now broadcast to children too.

 o always set default socks serverport so server doesn't complain if
   using default on sighup; Fix from Per Hedeland (per@erix.ericsson.se).

 o make server write out correct pid when started with -D.
   Problem reported by Per Hedeland (per@erix.ericsson.se).

 o depending on how one configured the userid's used by the server,
   it could sometimes fail. 
   Problem described by Per Hedeland (per@erix.ericsson.se).
