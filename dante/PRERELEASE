* release of Dante unless you want to help testing.

o Enabled code for shutting down idle sockd processes.

***  Wednesday, June 8, 2005 -- Dante v1.1.16-pre1

o Some additions to better preserve TCP semantics across connections.

o Allow PAM tests to be disabled.
  Thanks to Daniel <dragonheart@gentoo.org> for patch.

o Conflict between socks.h and netinet/in.h fixed.
  Thanks to Daniel <dragonheart@gentoo.org> for patch.

o Error in capi/socks.h fixed.
  Thanks to Alin Nastac <mrness@gentoo.org> for patch solving problem.

o Fix res_9_init related compilation problems on OS X.
  Problem reported by Changshin Lee <iasandcb@gmail.com>.

o Return immediate error if username/password is wrong in the common
  case, rather than delaying it for later.  Helps avoid the case where
  socks-clients cache the wrong username/password.  Reworked
  rule-checking code a little too.

o In one rare case, such as triggered in some LVS health-checker
  installations, a bug could make us leak descriptors. 
  Thanks to Antonio Paulo Salgado Forster <aforster@br.ibm.com> and
  Pete Harvey <Peter.Harvey@newcastle.ac.uk> for help with debugging.

o Fix a bug where server could hang while waiting for input from client
  during negotiation.  Thanks to Robert Marcano <robert@marcanoonline.com>.

o Fix formating of some warning messages.
  Thanks to James Carlson <james.d.carlson@sun.com>.
