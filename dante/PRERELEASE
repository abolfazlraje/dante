  o slightly smarter about what descriptors we leave open when
    forking of connectchild in client for non-blocking connect.
    Also don't setsid() in connectchild.

  o gethostbyaddr now correctly located on Solaris; prevented sockd
    from running, at least on Solaris 2.7 with libwrap.
    Reported by James Coe <jcoe@webstreetsecurities.com>.

 o work around linux/sysv bug involving getpwnam() preventing
   password authentication from working in some cases. 
   hp-ux may need similar workaround but not yet verified.

 o Prefer the result of getlogin() to getpwuid(getuid()).

 o HP-UX port.  Many thanks to Malte Cornils <malte@cornils.net>
   for help with the port. HP-UX 10.20 should work, HP-UX 11.00
   currently doesn't.

 o AIX port.  Many thanks to M. Everett Hinckley (everett@lsli.com)
   and Tommy Chan for doing the port.  Great work.
   AIX 4.2.1 should work.

 o share some of the client interposition code with the server;
   lets libwrap (and any other external library) use the
   hostname/hostaddress cache too, making things faster for
   those using libwrap.

 o always call gettimedout() regardless of select(), fixes an
   theoretically possible problem.
   Brought up by Per Hedeland (per@erix.ericsson.se).

 o assume the globally allowed methods are already set when parsing
   the rules.  Allows more checking/warning about "strange" rules.

 o fix a bug so portranges get parsed again, instead of reporting
   syntax error.

 o some cleanup/generalization in preparation for cryptography
   support.

 o in the case of the commands "bindreply" and "udpreply",
   "method" based itself on the controlconnection rather than the
   remote "reply".  Corrected to base itself on the remote reply.

 o when printing authinfo, include what the name of authmethod used
   is.

 o removed the "feature" that a user listed with the same name as
   a method would be considered special; too complex for practical
   use.  No more magic names.

 o clientrules now also take a method field, only non-socks
   method can be listed there of course; currently that's "none"
   and "rfc931".

 o call gethostbyname2() internally instead of gethostbyname();
   fixes a client problem present in some environments.
   Problem described by Per Hedeland (per@erix.ericsson.se).
