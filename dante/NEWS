***  Monday, May 31, 1999 -- Dante v1.0.0

 o support for sun/dec/sgi cc.

 o osf4.0a port.  Thanks to Jay Weber (jweb@accessus.net) for help
   with the port and an account to test it on.

 o Set subnegotiationversion in username method correctly.  Thanks to
   Marc Haber (Marc.Haber@gmx.de) and Olaf Titz (olaf@bigred.inka.de).

 o Caches resolved hostnames/addresses.  Problem of not having it
   first brought up by Devin Nate (devin.nate@bridgecomm.net), thanks.
   Several new variables were added to config.h for tuning the cache.
 
 o srchost flags settable in configfile, see sockd.conf(8) for more info.

 o Addressmatching much improved and should now be "complete".

 o libtool-1.3

 o Try to locate newest libc on linux, allow manual specification
   in worst case.

 o irix 6.2 port.

 o Update to autoconf 2.13 and automake 1.4.

 o New keyword in client configfile: "resolveprotocol".  Must
   be set to "fake" on clients that can not resolve hostnames.

 o Support resolving hostnames for socks v4 clients too (requires
   the Dante client but should work with any socks server).

 o Compilation problems on Solaris 7 fixed.  Reported by and fixed
   with the help of Stephen C. Hailey <haileyn@flash.net>.

 o Library conflict on linux systems with several libc versions
   (gnu/non-gnu?) resolved, reported by 
   Martin Piskernig <martin.piskernig@stuwo.at>.

 o Configparsing reworked, should no longer care much about the order
   of things.

 o The library with dlopen should be correctly found for socksify.
 
 o Let user know if we failed due to authentication on at msproxy
   server.

 o "protocolversion" renamed to "proxyprotocol" in clientconfig, 
   also changed the value names.

 o version in reply for socksv4 is not same as in request, reported
   by Stefan Reiner (stefanr@segue.at).

 o added experimental support for msproxy v2, supports tcp.

 o better support for clients that can't resolve hostnames.

 o nonblocking connects have a chance of working on linux too now.

***  Monday, December 14, 1998 -- Dante v0.91.1.

 o  a nasty typo.

***  Monday, December 14, 1998 -- Dante v0.91.0.

 o  all reported bugs and compilation problems fixed.
     
 o  much improved UDP support, using calls other than sendto()/recvfrom()
    on UDP sockets should now work.

 o  spread SO_KEEPALIVE to all appropriate sockets, added option
    "-n" to switch SO_KEEPALIVE off.  Old "-n" became "-N".

 o  nonblocking connect stuff redesigned, should now handle all cases
    and also makes ftp client in lynx work.

 o  more documentation available.

 o  --enable-diagnostic option added to configure

 o  cache's username/password, does not prompt twice.

 o  Server is no longer tested on Solaris 2.5.1, we have switched
    to 2.6 due to all the 2.5.1 specific problems.  Much of the bandaid
    necessary for Solaris 2.5.1 is still present in this version but
    will probably be removed in next version.

 o  Socksify program now also works on SunOS and Linux.

***  Monday, November 16, 1998 -- Dante v0.90.0.
 
 o  A socks client and server implementation for UNIX.
