***  Monday, December 14, 1998  -  Dante v0.91.1.

 o  a nasty typo.

***  Monday, December 14, 1998  -  Dante v0.91.0.

 o  all reported bugs and compilation problems fixed.
     
 o  much improved UDP support, using calls other than sendto()/recvfrom()
    on UDP sockets should now work.

 o  spread SO_KEEPALIVE to all appropriate sockets, added option
    "-n" to switch SO_KEEPALIVE off.  Old "-n" became "-N".

 o  nonblocking connect stuff redesigned, should now handle all cases
    and also makes ftp client in lynx work.

 o  more documentation available.

 o  --enable-diagnostic option added to configure

 o  cache's username/password, does not prompt twice.

 o  Server is no longer tested on Solaris 2.5.1, we have switched
    to 2.6 due to all the 2.5.1 specific problems.  Much of the bandaid
    necessary for Solaris 2.5.1 is still present in this version but
    will probably be removed in next version.

 o  Socksify program now also works on SunOS and Linux.


***  Monday, November 16, 1998  -  Dante v0.90.0.
 
 o  A socks client and server implementation for UNIX.
