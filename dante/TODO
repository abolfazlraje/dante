* add to exitsignalv.

* assume config.method is set when checking addedd rules, warn
  on error/strangeness.

* clean up (char)version (unsigned char)version and etc. stuff.

* always call gettimedout() regardless of select()?  Brought
  up by Per Hedeland (per@erix.ericsson.se).

* dl magic to get libwrap to share hostcache?

* if socks_lock() fails in vslog(), log anyway?

* sepearte auth struct per io object?  (could log ident username
  for bindreply)

* share host/addr cache across processes.

* get and send all argument to old signalhandler when necessary.

* clean up namespace.

* make requestchildren support multiple clients too.

* continue work on udp bind, or junk it completely?

* a max value for the number of free io/negotiator's?  mother could kill
  "redundant" ones.

* shrink io_t, too big.

* support giving a interface name instead of ip address?

* possible to specify what address/portrange server should use for
  outgoing connection in each rule?

* solaris cc needs -misalign due to alignment problems with sockaddr/
  sockaddr_in casts. causes coredump with ftp (passive ls) in client,
  in sockshost2sockaddr (util.c, line 271, version 1.94).
