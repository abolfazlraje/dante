* If the max number of filedescriptors is set to RLIM_INFINITY, we 
  need to do something different.

* look more at the openbsd non-blocking connect problem.

* too much debuginfo is now beeing produced when debuging is enabled.
  Need to change most of the "if (debug)" statements to "if (debug > 1), 
  if (debug > 2)", etc. so that it can again be usefull to the average
  user.

* start looking at expanding the bytecounter in sockd to 64 bits, or
  something else to prevent the total bytes transfered wrapping.

* look into if we can reduce the stacksize of clientmethod_gssapi(),
  as it creates problems with e.g. solaris' host command.
  Do we really require so big gssapi buffers?

* connections blocked due to authenticationerrors or other things should
  say block(n), not pass(n), or?

* change gethostby* to getnameinfo(3)/getaddrinfo(3), which should
  hopefully be threadsafe on most platforms.

* should try to get route for v4 first, since it's faster setup time?

* (bandwidth?) module could support a limit on the total amount transfered
  per time (day/hour) also.  Usefull?

* connecttimeout should mean "timeout for connect(2) on behalf of socks
  client".

* make request-children support multiple clients.

* change _t struct's to typedef.

* share host/addr cache across processes.

* clean up namespace (including for dlib, function names can collide with apps)

* make requestchildren support multiple clients too.

* shrink io_t, too big.  Can we find out what the maximum amount of 
  bytes needed for importing/exporting gssapi auth is?

* IPV6 support

* check for more configure related code that is no longer used
