* share host/addr cache across processes.

* get and send all argument to old signalhandler when necessary.

* clean up (char)version (unsigned char)version and etc. stuff.

* make requestchildren support multiple clients too.
  
* continue work on udp bind.

  "redundant" ones.

* shrink io_t, too big.

* support giving a interface name instead of ip address?

* possible to specify what address/portrange server should use for
  outgoing connection in each rule?
