* if socks_lock() fails in vslog(), log anyway?

* share host/addr cache across processes.

* get and send all argument to old signalhandler when necessary.

* clean up namespace.

* make requestchildren support multiple clients too.

* a max value for the number of free io/negotiator's?  mother could kill
  "redundant" ones.

* shrink io_t, too big.

* support giving a interface name instead of ip address?

* possible to specify what address/portrange server should use for
  outgoing connection in each rule?

* solaris cc needs -misalign due to alignment problems with sockaddr/
  sockaddr_in casts. causes coredump with ftp (passive ls) in client,
  in sockshost2sockaddr (util.c, line 271, version 1.94).

* match configure/manual config/pid location
