- cleanup autoconf (HAVE_RECVFROM_CHAR+HAVE_FAULTY_XXX_PROTO 
  (rename to HAVE_SOLARIS_PROTO?)

* look at difference between v4 and v5 bind.

* clean up (char)version (unsigned char)version and etc. stuff.

* add support for srchost_t in serverconfig.

* overkill to reserve a requestchild just to forward bindreplys, 
  fix it via SIGIO probably. 

* continue work on udp bind.

* a max value for the number of free io/negotiator's?  mother could kill
  "redundant" ones.

* shrink io_t, too big.

* look at ssl support, need to support atleast one way to encrypt communication.

* should the children rescan their current clients when they receive 
  SIGHUP, disconnecting clients rules no longer allow?

* lib manpages, trim away most of Rfoo references. make/use general
  socks man page

* support giving a interface name instead of ip address?

* should be possible to specify what address/portrange server should use for
  outgoing connection in each rule?

* support a "state" keyword similar to ipf for udp?
