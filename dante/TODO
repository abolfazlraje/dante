* checkmodule matches external against licesensed ipaddress, if external
  is an interface name however, it looks like it can contain multiple
  unlicensed ipaddresses, as long as the interface contains at least
  one licensed.

* there is a race condition in bw stuff between rulespermit() and
  bwuse().

* change _t struct's to typedef.

* allocate fd_set's with malloc() for overflow protection.

* share host/addr cache across processes.

* get and send all argument to old signalhandler when necessary.

* clean up namespace.

* make requestchildren support multiple clients too.

* shrink io_t, too big.

* Solaris cc needs -misalign due to alignment problems with sockaddr/
  sockaddr_in casts. causes coredump with ftp (passive ls) in client,
  in sockshost2sockaddr (util.c, line 271, version 1.94).

* match configure/manual config/pid location

* port code for interface/route info retrieval to OSF

* IPV6 support
