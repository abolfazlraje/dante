           [ General ]

* socks_connect() should take a string argument to store reason for error
  in.  If it is e.g., dns resolving that fails, we can not read that from
  errno.

* change _t struct's to typedef.

* IPV6 support

* check for more configure related code that is no longer used

* remove unused libs, e.g., in ldap.m4, if not enabled

* Can we find out what the maximum amount of bytes needed for
  importing/exporting gssapi auth is?


           [ Server ]

* shrink io_t, too big and creates dependency on large socketbuffers 
  between mother and i/o-children.

* should the session end summary include the bytes transfered during
  initial socks negotiation also?  And what about the overhead of
  e.g. gssapi?  We include the overhead of the socks udp protocol,
  but not gssapi.  That is not consistent.

* code for getting interface mac without ifconfig(8).

* add an option to resolve ipaddresses used for logging?  Have a 
  dns-cache, so should not take much extra time.  Perhaps
  add the resolved hostnames in parantheses next to the ipaddress?

* should make reloading config file a two-step operation.  First 
  parse and load the new config into one sockscf object, and 
  if all is ok, only then clear the old config and start using
  the new one.

* make requestchildren support multiple clients too.

           [ Client ]

* make route-search use longest-prefix match and support priority?

* look into if we can reduce the stacksize of clientmethod_gssapi(),
  as it creates problems with e.g. solaris' host command.
  Do we really require so big gssapi buffers?

* change gethostby* to getnameinfo(3)/getaddrinfo(3), which should
  hopefully be threadsafe on most platforms.
