The shell script socksify in the bin directory is meant to aid in
using socks with already compiled dynamic binaries.  This works by
setting the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to libdsocks.  It will
then wrap all networking-related system calls.

When used the script can socksify a program by simply giving it as a
parameter to socksify:

socksify ftp ftp.example.org
