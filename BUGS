	Things known not to work.

- using something else than sendto()/recvfrom() on udp sockets.

- calling getsockname() on a connection established with a nonblocking
  descriptor. (breaks ftpclient in lynx)

- static dlib should not be built

- documentation is severely lacking.  Help on this would be especially
  appreciated.
