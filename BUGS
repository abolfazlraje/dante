To report a new bug, mail dante-bugs@inet.no.
Make sure you read the FAQ (http://www.inet.no/dante/FAQ/) first.

Bugs in the server:
 - When server-chaining is used, if sockd1 cannot resolve hostname
   H sent by the client, it will not ask sockd2 to connect to
   hostname H, even though sockd2 may be able to resolve H and connect.

   Reported by Mathieu DELAPLACE <mathieu.delaplace@gmail.com.example.com>

Bugs in the client:
 - If debugging is enabled, there are a some cases where a deadlock
   can occur.  Not analyzed yet.

There are various known problems due to limitations on certain platforms
that can cause problems for Dante, but which we currently do not consider
bugs in Dante, but rather in the host system.  We have tried to work
around most of these.  The below lists the one for which there currently
is no workaround implemented.


Generic:
  - The --enable-profiling option does not work properly on OpenSolaris.
    (possibly a problem when gssapi is used, with pthreads/_mcount.)

Server part: none known.

Client part:
  - On OpenBSD, 4.5 at least, there seems to be a bug involving file status
    flags on descriptor passed back and fourth between processes.  This can
    make a client that performs non-blocking connects hang forever waiting
    for the connect-result to be reported.

  - GSSAPI related:
    - The threadlibrary on OpenBSD 4.5 has numerous problems.  Some
      of these can lead to the client crashing.  An unfortunate
      side-effect of enabling gssapi in the client is that it might
      lead applications that are not threaded to "become threaded"
      due to linking with the gssapi-libraries, if the gssapi-libraries
      are threaded.

    - TCP oob data does not work in the client in buffered mode as
      we have no code to handle the oob flag in the io-buffer.
      Only affects Linux/glibc platforms, and it seems, Solaris 5.11,
      when socksifying applications that use stdio for network i/o
      instead of the standard system calls.

    - Applications with symbols that collide with kerberos/gssapi
      library functions can result in segmentation fault if these
      applications are the first applications run after getting a
      kerberos ticket.  Some examples are dig, host, and nslookup,
      which share common code with a variable that has the same name
      as the MIT kerberos error_message() function.

      Debugging code in MIT kerberos can result in this function being
      called even if the application would normally work.

      A workaround is to run a different application before using any
      program which has this problem.

    - The host command fails on OpenBSD when gssapi is enabled.
      The exact cause of this has not yet been fully debugged, but
      seems to be related to the host command doing something that
      conflicts with the heimdal gssapi-related libraries.

    - On FreeBSD 7.2 there is at least one bug that prevents socksify
      from working with gssapi-authentication unless there is a direct
      dns route.  The problem is not so easy to diagnose. but involves
      an error message similar to this found in socks.log:
      "Rconnect(): connecting socket 4 to a.b.c.d.e failed: Bad file
      descriptor (errno = X)".

      This occurs because the Dante library needs to call getnameinfo(3)
      during establishment of a gssapi-based socks-session, but
      sometimes the reason it needs to establish a socks-session is
      because getnameinfo(3) was called by the client.  That means
      there are two instances of getnameinfo(3) on the stack, and
      Dante's getnameinfo(3) call ends up closing the socket the
      clients getnameinfo(3) call created.

      See http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=139734 for more
      information.

      A workaround for this problem is to always have a direct dns
      route in socks.conf if using gssapi.

      Note that a direct dns route is recommended regardless of
      whether you are using gssapi or not, for performance reasons if
      nothing else.
