***  Friday, May 14, 1999 -- Dante v1.0.0-pre1.

 o support for sun/dec/sgi cc.

 o osf4.0a port.  Thanks to Jay Weber (jweb@accessus.net) for help
   with the port and an account to test it on.

 o Set subnegotiationversion in username method correctly.  Thanks to
   Marc Haber (Marc.Haber@gmx.de) and Olaf Titz (olaf@bigred.inka.de).

 o Caches resolved hostnames/addresses.  Problem of not having it
   first brought up by Devin Nate (devin.nate@bridgecomm.net), thanks.
   Several new variables were added to config.h for tuning the cache.
 
 o srchost flags settable in configfile, see sockd.conf(8) for more info.

 o Addressmatching much improved and should now be "complete".

 o libtool-1.3

 o Try to locate newest libc on linux, allow manual specification
   in worst case.

 o irix 6.2 port.

 o Update to autoconf 2.13 and automake 1.4.

 o New keyword in client configfile: "resolveprotocol".  Must
   be set to "fake" on clients that can not resolve hostnames.

 o Support resolving hostnames for socks v4 clients too (requires
   the Dante client but should work with any socks server).

 o Compilation problems on Solaris 7 fixed.  Reported by and fixed
   with the help of Stephen C. Hailey <haileyn@flash.net>.

 o Library conflict on linux systems with several libc versions
   (gnu/non-gnu?) resolved, reported by 
   Martin Piskernig <martin.piskernig@stuwo.at>.

 o Configparsing reworked, should no longer care much about the order
   of things.

***  Friday, March 12, 1999  -  Dante v0.92.0-pre3.

 o Socks v4 support got broken, reported by
   Devin Nate (nated@bridgecomm.net).

***  Thursday, March 11, 1999  -  Dante v0.92.0-pre2.

 o The library with dlopen should be correctly found for socksify.
 
 o Let user know if we failed due to authentication on at msproxy
   server.

 o Don't fail if a signalhandler for SIGALRM is already
   installed, ignore it.  Client will probably timeout after some
   minutes though, so not a real solution.  (A real solution would
   entice more work than is currently alloted for this.  Send your
   free pizza to Inferno Nettverk and it may change.)

***  Monday, March 1, 1998  -  Dante v0.92.0-pre1.

 o "protocolversion" renamed to "proxyprotocol" in clientconfig, 
   also changed the value names.

 o version in reply for socksv4 is not same as in request, reported
   by Stefan Reiner (stefanr@segue.at).

 o added experimental support for msproxy v2, supports tcp.

 o if the environment variable SOCKS_NORESOLVE is set,
   don't try to resolve hostnames locally.

 o better support for clients that can't resolve hostnames.

 o nonblocking connects have a chance of working on linux too now.
