 o libtool-1.3.2

 o Building of dlib/interposition.c cleaned up.

 o tried to make logformat a little more consistent, not perfect yet
   though.

 o try to throttle childcreation if it looks like there is a problem.
   Suggested by Robert Loomans (robertl@jinx.silas.unsw.edu.au).

 o added a new method: "rfc931"; matches users against rfc931/ident
   lookup.  Requested by Per Hedeland (per@erix.ericsson.se).

 o added a new keyword: "user:"; limits the acceptable users on 
   a rule-by-rule basis.

 o rewrote addressmatch().  This sort of reverses the logic and is also no
   longer recursive.  Much Thanks to Per Hedeland (per@erix.ericsson.se)
   for pointing out some problems here and helping with making this
   hopefully more correct, any mistakes are obviously my own.

 o SIGINFO signal is now broadcast to children too.

 o always set default socks serverport so server doesn't complain if
   using default on sighup; Fix from Per Hedeland (per@erix.ericsson.se).

 o make server write out correct pid when started with -D.
   Problem reported by Per Hedeland (per@erix.ericsson.se).

 o depending on how one configured the userid's used by the server,
   it could sometimes fail. 
   Problem described by Per Hedeland (per@erix.ericsson.se).
