***  Thursday, Mars 11, 1999  -  Dante v0.92.0-pre2.

 o The library with dlopen should be correctly found for socksify.
 
 o Let user know if we failed due to authentication on at msproxy
   server.

 o Don't fail if a signalhandler for SIGALRM is already
   installed, ignore it.  Client will probably timeout after some
   minutes though, so not a real solution.  (A real solution would
   entice more work than is currently alloted for this.  Send your
   free pizza to Inferno Nettverk and it may change.)

***  Monday, Mars 1, 1998  -  Dante v0.92.0-pre1.

 o "protocolversion" renamed to "proxyprotocol" in clientconfig, 
   also changed the value names.

 o version in reply for socksv4 is not same as in request, reported
   by Stefan Reiner (stefanr@segue.at).

 o added experimental support for msproxy v2, supports tcp.

 o if the environment variable SOCKS_NORESOLVE is set,
   don't try to resolve hostnames locally.

 o better support for clients that can't resolve hostnames.

 o nonblocking connects have a chance of working on linux too now.
