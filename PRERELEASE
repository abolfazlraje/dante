***  Tuesday, June 19, 2012 -- Dante v1.4.0-pre1
***

 o GSSAPI "clear" is no longer enabled by default, as it is not part of the
   SOCKS GSSAPI standard per se.

 o Errors related to the machine Dante is running on not having any route
   to a clients target destination are now reported as general errors with
   log level "warning", in addition to as part of the normal session close.

 o external.rotation was not handling non-IPv4 target addresses correctly.
   Reported and diagnosed by Rudolf Polzer <rpolzer@one-it.de.example.com>.

 o The --disable-libwrap option has been renamed --without-libwrap.

 o Fixed bug that would cause the following warning to sometimes be
   reported despite this not being a problem:
   "warning: accept(2) failed: Resource temporarily unavailable"

 o SIGINFO log information extended to include information about current
   buffering status and UDP latency.

 o Real-time scheduling priority settings and CPU affinity settings made
   available in sockd.conf.

   See https://www.inet.no/dante/files/dante_realtime_preview.pdf for
   a performance analysis done in relation to this work.

 o General API for setting socket options on TCP/UDP sockets used by Dante
   made available in sockd.conf.

 o Support for cross compilation of client library for Android
   (system name 'arm-linux-androideabi').
