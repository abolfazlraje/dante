* release of Dante unless you have to or are willing to help testing.

 o new method added: "pam".  Code contributed by
   Patrick Bihan-Faou, MindStep Corporation, patrick@mindstep.com.

 o let client-rules have their own global methodline, "clientmethod",
   default value set to "none".
   The global "method" is only used for socks-rules now.

 o delay checking of password/etc til we have received the socks
   request (rather than during negotiation, as was the case).
   Required for supporting passwordbased authentication via non-socks
   methods, e.g. pam.

 o socklen_t definition updated for NetBSD 1.5U.
   Problem report and patch submitted by Janne Snabb <snabb@ssh.com>.

 o Output from 'config.guess' is not sufficient to determine use
   of elf on NetBSD.

 o BSDI 4.1 doesn't have freeifaddrs(), but uses free()
   Problem reported by "Zand, Nooshin" <nooshin.zand@intel.com>
